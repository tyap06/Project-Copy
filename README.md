# **My Personal Project**

## **A Recipe Manager Application**

**What will the application do?:**

- My application will be able to keep track of recipes that are added. I will have different categories for each type of
recipe, such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert. My app will also be able to sort and filter through recipes when 
  a filter is set. Different cuisines could be filtered for, and my app will be able to find recipes that correspond to it.
  Users will be able to add and delete recipes. When a recipe is added, users will have an option to upload a picture of the food.
Users will also be able to rate the recipe based on a 5 star scale. When viewing a recipe, users can find the ingredients needed,
  directions/steps to prepare the recipe, serving size, and nutrition facts.
  
**Who will use it?**

- This recipe manager application is catered to users that are interested in cooking and want a place to keep track of recipes.
Users can have all of their recipes stored in this app for easy access.
  
**Why is this project of interest to you?**

- I am interested in this project because I love to cook and try out new recipes. A recipe manager application will be 
  very useful for me to have all recipes stored in one place and easily accessible.
